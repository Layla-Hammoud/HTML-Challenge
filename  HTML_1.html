        <h2>Establish career expectations</h2>
        <p><strong>Software developers</strong> can decide on a direction and establish where to take their career by setting goals.
            These goals can be different areas of their career or they can progress toward a specific end goal.
            Accomplishing goals can help developers create a career that aligns with what they want. They can set
            expectations and use goals as individual steps to help them achieve those expectations. Taking the time to
            consider and plan their goals can help them decide what to accomplish and how.</p>
        <h2>Improve skills</h2>
        <p><strong> Software developers </strong>work in a field that's constantly developing new technological advances. Setting goals
            that help them expand their experience can also help them improve their skills. Gaining new skills can keep
            a software developer interested in their field long term and help them develop new interests that may affect
            their overall career trajectory. Staying updated on new technologies and techniques can also improve the
            career opportunities available to a software developer.</p>
